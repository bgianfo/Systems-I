The files you have retrieved have the following contents:

	RUN		script for testing your program

	header.mak	for use with 'makemake'

	args.*		command line arguments to 'pipeline'

	ifile.*		specific stdin used to test redirection
	input.default	default stdin fed to 'pipeline'

	result.*	specific stdout used to test redirection
	stderr.*	expected stderr from 'pipeline'
	stdout.*	expected stdout from 'pipeline'

The RUN script automatically runs all of the supplied tests against your
pipeline program, and compares your program's output with the expected
output.  You should see a series of lines beginning "Test n:" (where 'n'
is a test number), with the tests separated by lines of equal signs; if
you see any other output, that indicates a difference between your
program's results and the correct results, which you should look at more
closely.  Your program's results are put into files whose names indicate
the test number; e.g., for test 5, the names would be ',err.5', ',out.5',
',result.5'.  Note that not all tests have ,result files - only tests
which explicitly redirect stdout will have these.

Any differences between your output and the expected output should be
corrected before submitting your program.

NOTE:  These test files test only some of your program's functionality!
Be sure to exhaustively test your solution.
