The files db.* and input.* are test input files; stdout.* and stderr.*
are the sample output from those tests.

If you are testing somewhere other than on a CS Solaris system, you
will need to define your own versions of the allocation routines.  I
recommend implementing these as functions that invoke the malloc() and
free() routines.  REMEMBER TO GET RID OF THESE FUNCTIONS WHEN YOU MOVE
YOUR CODE BACK TO THE CS SYSTEMS, as they will prevent you from using
the correct allocation routines.

You can test your program with the RUN script found here, or with these
commands (e.g., for test #4):

   Bourne shell (/bin/sh):

	project2 db.4 < input.4 > out.4 2> err.4
	diff stdout.4 out.4
	diff stderr.4 err.4

   C shell (/bin/csh):

	(project2 db.4 < input.4 > out.4) >& err.4
	diff stdout.4 out.4
	diff stderr.4 out.4

Any differences between your output and the test output should be
corrected before submitting your program.

After each test is run, the file MAX_MEMORY_USED will indicate how much
dynamic memory your program used for that test.

NOTE:  These test files test only some of the program's functionality!
Be sure to exhaustively test your solution.
